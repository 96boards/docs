# Downloading install media

Installer images for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL for ARM) can be obtained
from Red Hat. If you qualify for the [Red Hat Developer Program](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/red-hat-developer-program-benefits/)
installer images can be found at (no-cost registration required):
[https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download/](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download/) .

After downloading an installer image, please carefully study the list of
platform quirks and workarounds below. If you need further information
to complete the install process then there is a Developerbox specific
guide to [Booting an operating system installer](./) which can be read
alongside [the documentation on the Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/).

# Quirks and workarounds

## [Hardware] USB/PCIe networking

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is based on the a kernel without support for
the built-in network interface. This kernel version does not include
support for the built-in
network interface. This must be worked around by using an external network
device.

Both PCIe or USB network devices are suitable for this, although it is
important to select a device that is already supported by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
kernel. If in doubt, please ask on the [Developerbox forum](https://discuss.96boards.org/c/products/developerbox).

## [Firmware] Ensure the system firmware version is up to date

Full support for standards compliant PCIe enumeration was added to the
Developerbox system firmware starting with version 38. Older versions of the
firmware do not allow Red Hat Enterprise Linux to enumerate PCIe devices.

The firmware version is displayed both at the top of the firmware splash screen
and as part of the system information displayed in the firmware menus.

If your firmware is not recent enough then please see the [*System Firmware Update* section of the Install Guide](README.md#system-firmware-update).

## [Firmware] Set O/S Hardware Description to ACPI

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 requires that the Developerbox platform hardware be
described using ACPI. The firmware default is to use device
tree to describe the hardware so this must be changed.

To switch to ACPI mode:

 * Press **Escape** once the `Press ESCAPE for boot options` message
   appears
 * Select **Device Manager** and **SynQuacer Platform Settings**
 * Select **O/S Hardware Description** and choose **ACPI**
 * Press **Escape** and then press **Y** to save and exit
 * Press **Escape** again, to return to the main menu
 * Select **Reset**

## [Install, First boot] Disable incompatible PCIe features

Two features must be disabled to allow PCIe to enumerate and allocate
interrupts correctly. Patches to address the underlying issues are
regarded as bug fixes and will be backported to LTS kernels over time.

If your kernel is affected the workaround is described below

For install **and** first boot:

 * Wait for the grub menu to appear, then press **e** to edit the
   commands before booting
 * Use the editor to add `pcie_aspm=off pci=nomsi` to the kernel command line (this
   is the line commencing with the word `linux`)
 * Check this document for any other *[Install]* or *[First boot]*
   workarounds. Once all kernel arguments are updated, boot the kernel
   by pressing **Ctrl-X**.

To make the change permanent:

 * Wait for Red Hat Enterprise Linux to boot, then login and start a Terminal application
 * Edit `/etc/default/grub` as root, for example: `sudo vi /etc/default/grub`
 * Add `pcie_aspm=off pci=nomsi` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`
 * Save the file and close the editor
 * Run `sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg` to
   regenerate the grub config files

## [Install, First boot] Disable the nouveau driver

Red Hat Enterprise Linux configures the kernel to run with 64k pages (because they
improve system performance), however the nouveau driver for the GT-710
graphics card included in the kit will not initialize successfully
on kernels that are configured for 64k pages.

This can be worked around by disabling the nouveau driver. This causes
the operating system to fallback to the EFI framebuffer configured by
the firmware. This reduces the graphics card to a dumb device that scans
out from a fixed frame buffer. All 3D operations will be emulated in
software running the Cortex-A53 processors. The default desktop environment
will operate correctly but the lack of hardware acceleration is noticeable
in some areas, in particular when bringing up the Activities overview.

For install **and** first boot:

 * Wait for the grub menu to appear, then press **e** to edit the
   commands before booting
 * Use the editor to add `modprobe.blacklist=nouveau` to the kernel command line (this
   is the line commencing with the word `linux`)
 * Check this document for any other *[Install]* or *[First boot]*
   workarounds. Once all kernel arguments are updated, boot the kernel
   by pressing **Ctrl-X**.

To make the change permanent:

 * Wait for Red Hat Enterprise Linux to boot, then login and start a Terminal application
 * Edit `/etc/default/grub` as root, for example: `sudo vi /etc/default/grub`
 * Add `modprobe.blacklist=nouveau` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`
 * Save the file and close the editor
 * Run `sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg` to
   regenerate the grub config files

Note that, although the default desktop is performant enough for occasional
server maintainance, heavy desktop users may prefer to run a lightweight desktop
environment with minimal or no use of 3D acceleration.
No suitable lightweight desktop is included in
the base operating system but XFCE is available via
[EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) .

Alternatively if you wish to use your Developerbox as a headless server it is
possible to remove the graphics card entirely. When the
graphics card is removed all console activity (both EDK2 menus and the
Linux console) will automatically switch from using the graphics card to
using the debug UART. The debug UART is connected to the micro-USB
socket behind the I/O shield on the back panel.

The automatic switching of the console means the system maintenance
capabilities via the UART are equivalent to those available via
the graphics card, and the power saved as a result of removing the
graphics card is significant.
