## Starting the board for the first time


**The Oxalis comes preloaded with Debian Linux and can be up and running with a few simple steps:**

- Connect the Oxalis to your network
- Connect the USB Cable. Via the micro USB connector X7 which will give you access to the console port and the integrated CMSIS-TAP debugger

> Note: The above setup will cause Oxalis Board to Auto Power up when it is plugged into power

- Connect the power supply to the Oxalis. The board will begin to boot Debian Linux immediately
