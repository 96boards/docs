**The 96Boards guides index** is a one-stop-shop for all 96Boards guides found around this repository. The index is split into several discrete sections intended to seperate our board families while also going deeper to providing both generic guides (which span across each family) and board specific guides (which are limited to the chosen board).

## Generic Guides

**Generic guides** apply to all 96Boards from all families. This means the guides in this section can be used on Consumer, IoT, and Enterprise edition boards.
