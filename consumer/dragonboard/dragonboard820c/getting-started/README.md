## Starting the board for the first time

**To start the board, follow these simple steps:**

- Step 1: Connect the HDMI cable to the 820c HDMI connector (marked J6) and to the LCD Monitor.
- Step 2: Connect the mouse and keyboard to the 820C USB connectors marked J2 and. (It doesn’t matter which order
you connect them in. You can also connect via an external USB Hub.)
- Step 3: Ensure that the boot switches S1 are set to ‘0000’, all in Off position.
- Step 4: Connect the power supply to power connector J1.
- Step 5: Plug the power supply into a power outlet.

The board will start the booting process, and you should see Linux boot up. The ’power up’ blue LED ‘DS10’ should
illuminate.

> NOTE: The first boot takes 3-4 minutes due to first time initialization. Subsequent boot times should be faster in
the range of 1-2 minutes.
