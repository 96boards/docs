# Introduction

This guide will walk you through Interfacing with Arduino IO on the FPGA Mezzanine using a dedicated C Library.

## Hardware Setup

- **[Any 96Boards CE Board](/products/ce/)**
- **Shiratech FPGA Mezzanine**

## Software setup

- **[Install MRAA on 96Boards CE](https://youtu.be/c8b6pcc6H2c)**
- **Clone the fpga_mezz_lib repository**
    - `git clone https://github.com/96boards-projects/fpga_mezz_lib`

## Using the Library

> Note: The library currently only supports the Arduino header

1. **Pin Map:** This library uses the following pin map for the Arduino header

2. **Macros:** Following macros will come handy

- Macros for Multifunction IO Pins on the Arduino Header to be used with pinMode()
    - `ARD_I2C_0_FUNC`: Refers to GPIO15 and GPIO14 responsible for I2C0 Bus
    - `ARD_SPI_FUNC`: Refers to GPIO10 to GPIO13 responsible for SPI Bus
    - `ARD_UART_FUNC`: Refers to GPIO0 and GPIO1 responsible for UART0 Bus
    - `ARD_I2C_1_FUNC`: Refers to GPIO17 and GPIO16 responsible for I2C1 Bus
- I2C Bus used by the FPGA Mezzanine
    - `I2C_BUS`: Just in case a 96Boards has a different internal Bus on I2C0 pins.
- Macros for Input or Output Mode used in pinMode()
    - `INPUT`: Value 1
    - `OUTPUT`: Value 0
- Macros for High or LOW GPIO state used in digitalWrite() and digitalRead()
    - `HIGH`: Value 1
    - `LOW`: Value 0
- Macros for Multifunction IO Pin state used in pinFunction()
    - `FUNC_PASSTHROUGH`: Sets I2c, SPI or UART in Passthrough mode.
    - `FUNC_GPIO`: Sets I2c, SPI or UART pins in GPIO mode.

3. **Functions:**

- **check_version(mraa_i2c_context i2c)**
    - This function returns the current firmware revision of the FPGA Mezzanine which is stored in the REV_REG 0x00.
    - Input:
        - `i2c`: MRAA I2C context of the FPGA Mezzanine on bus 0 and address 0x6f
    - Returns revision as `int` value.
    - Returns `-1` if I2C communication fails.
- **test(mraa_i2c_context i2c)**
    - This function sets a specific value to the TEST_REG 0x01 and reads back the value to test I2C communication.
    - Input:
        - `i2c`: MRAA I2C context of the FPGA Mezzanine on bus 0 and address 0x6f
    - Returns `1` if test passed.
    - Returns `-1` if an error occurs.
- **pinFunction(u_int8_t func_type, u_int8_t func, mraa_i2c_context i2c)**
    - This function sets Multi-Functional pins to either PassThrough to LowSpeed header or GPIO.
    - Inputs:
        - `func_type`: The MultiFunctional pins you want to toggle. These may be:
            - `ARD_I2C_0_FUNC`: for GPIO 14 and 15 that are connected to the I2C0 bus.
            - `ARD_I2C_1_FUNC`: for GPIO 16 and 17 that are connected to the I2C1 bus.

            - `FUNC_PASSTHROUGH`: The pins are directly connected to their respective Bus on the 96Boards Low Speed Header.
            - `FUNC_GPIO`: The pins are detached from the Low Speed Header and can be used as regular GPIO pins using the digitalWrite and digitalRead functions.
        - `i2c`: MRAA I2C context of the FPGA Mezzanine on bus 0 and address 0x6f
    - Returns `-1` if an error occurs.
- **pinMode(u_int8_t pin, u_int8_t mode, mraa_i2c_context i2c)**
