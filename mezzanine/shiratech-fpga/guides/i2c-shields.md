# Introduction

This guide will walk you through Interfacing with Arduino Shields that use I2C bus.

## Hardware Setup

- **[Any 96Boards CE Board](/products/ce/)**
- **Shiratech FPGA Mezzanine**
- **I2C Shield or Sensor**
  - For the Purpose of this guide I will be using:
    - [MPU6050 IMU Module](https://www.amazon.com/MPU-6050-MPU6050-Accelerometer-Gyroscope-Converter/dp/B008BOPN40/)
    - [I2C LCD Module 1602](https://www.amazon.com/Qunqi-Serial-Backlight-Arduino-MEGA2560/dp/B01E4YUT3K)
    - [PCA9685 Servo Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1411)

## Software setup

- **[Install MRAA on 96Boards CE](https://youtu.be/c8b6pcc6H2c)**
- **[Install UPM on 96Boards CE](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/building.md)**

## Running the Demos

- The I2C ports on the Arduino and Raspberry Pie headers act as a pass-through to the I2C0 Pins on the Low Speed Header.
- We first need to enable the i2c pass-through: `sudo i2cset 0 0x6f 0x13 0x00`
- This means and device connected over I2C via the FPGA Mezzanine should show up by simply running: `sudo i2cdetect -r 0`

### MPU6050: C

For the MPU6050, we are going to use one of the example codes from the MRAA repository:

- Fetch the code: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa/master/examples/c/i2c_mpu6050.c`
- Compile the code: `gcc i2c_mpu6050.c -o i2c_mpu6050 -lmraa`
- Run the code: `sudo ./i2c_mpu6050`
- After 5 seconds you should see Accelerometer and Gyroscope data show up and refresh every 2 seconds.

### I2C 1602 LCD and PCA9685 Servo Controller: Python

For a combined demo of LCD module and PCA9685 Servo controller here is a small python script using the UPM Library:

- Carefully snap the Servo Shield on the Arduino headers of the FPGA mezzanine.
- Connect the I2C LCD to the I2C pins on the Servo Shield
- Connect a 5v Servo on Channel 0.
- Copy the following code and save it as `servo.py`

```
from upm import pyupm_adafruitss as adass
from upm import pyupm_lcm1602 as lcm1602
import time

serv = adass.adafruitss(0,0x40)
lcd = lcm1602.Lcm1602()

lcd.displayOn()
lcd.clear()
lcd.setCursor(0,0)
lcd.write("Hello OpenHours")
lcd.setCursor(1,0)

while True:
    serv.servo(0,1,0)
    lcd.write("Servo Pos: 0  ")
    lcd.setCursor(1,0)
    time.sleep(1)
    serv.servo(0,1,90)
    lcd.write("Servo Pos: 90 ")
    lcd.setCursor(1,0)
    time.sleep(1)
    serv.servo(0,1,160)
    lcd.write("Servo Pos: 160")
    lcd.setCursor(1,0)
    time.sleep(1)

```

- Run it as `python3 servo.py`
- The servo should now start moving and the LCD should display the servo's current position.
